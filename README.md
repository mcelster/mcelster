## Hi there üëã
I am Marie Elster, a CS and EE sophomore at UMass Amherst! I love solving problems, and I love learning. Even more so when it involves computers. Whether it's high-level Python code, or low-level logic gates in a digital system, I am always thrilled to dissect, learn, and solve technical problems! My interests include machine learning, electronics, astronomy, music, and art. My most recent project is a generative AI music model I developed with my teammates through Break Through Tech AI at Mathworks. It employs an LSTM model to generate a melody, so if you're interested, check it out!
